h_title,The Genes From Space monitoring tool uses Earth Observations (EO) to track habitat changes over time and infer population trends as indicators of genetic diversity.,,
h_exp1_ti,**-> What can the tool be used for?**,,
h_exp1_te,"Leveraging public EO data, the tool enables users to estimate two genetic diversity indicators adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity:  \n- the **Ne500 indicator**, indicating the fraction of populations with an effective population size (Ne) above 500 units. Populations with Ne below 500 units are at risk of genetic erosion. \n- the **Populations Maintained indicator (PM)**, indicating the fraction of populations that are maintained (i.e., that did not extinct) over time.\n\n Developed within the BON in a box platform, the tool simplifies the process of accessing EO datasets, running analyses, and estimating genetic diversity indicators. Ultimately, this tool offers a scalable and accessible solution for researchers, conservationists, and policymakers to monitor and protect biodiversity at local, regional, and global levels.\n\nFor detailed information on methods and assumptions underlying the tool, check out the [Genes from Space](https://teams.issibern.ch/genesfromspace/) website.",,
h_exp2_ti,**-> How does the tool work?**,,
h_exp2_te,"The figure below provides an overview of how the tool works. There a two main  main inputs: \n1. **Populations Distribution Map**: This map represents the geographic distribution of the species' populations, typically derived from field observations of the studied species. The observation can be provided by the user, or retrieved from a public repository (GBIF) using the tool. \n2. **Habitat Suitability Maps**: These maps depict changes in the species' suitable habitat over time. These maps are generated by the tool using Earth observation-derived data and models.\n\n Using these inputs, the tool assesses how the size of suitable habitat for each population changes over time. This analysis can identify populations that have completely lost their habitat over a given period (estimating the PM indicator). Additionally, by combining suitable habitat size with an estimate of population density, the tool can estimate the size of each population, which is then used to estimate the Ne500 indicator.\n\n The interactive form will ask which data to use for representing the populations distribution, habitat change, and set the parameters to estimate the indicators.",,
h_exp3_ti,**-> How to run the tool?**,,
h_exp3_te,"The tool runs within [Bon in a Box](https://boninabox.geobon.org/), a platform designed to develop and share tools that support biodiversity monitoring. The tool can be launched through the standard  [BON in a Box interface](http://130.60.24.27/pipeline-form); however, the numerous options and parameters may make this challenging for beginners. To address this, we propose the **interactive form** below, which guides users through the preparation and execution of a run with the tool.",,
0_ti,### Run the tool via the Interactive Form,,
0_te,"Use the form below to prepare and launch your tool run. As you complete each field, the form will dynamically reveal new options, guiding you step-by-step through the setup process.",,
1_ti,##### Step 1: Define the geographic distribution of populations,,
1_te,"The first step defines the boundaries of the studied populations, typically derived from field observations of the studied species. The observation can be provided by the user, or retrieved from a public repository (GBIF) using the tool. ",,
1_exp_ti,**-> What defines the populations geographic distribution?**,,
1_exp_te,"The geographic distribution of populations is defined using three key inputs: \n-  **Species of Interest**: A terrestrial species whose habitat changes can be detected through satellite imagery, such as vegetation type shifts or forest loss. Avoid selecting threats that cannot be monitored using Earth observations, such as poaching. \n- **Area of Interest**: A specific geographic region where the species' populations are located, such as a country or a defined area. Please refrain from selecting very large regions (e.g., entire continents) to avoid overloading the servers. \n- **Observation Period**: Define a baseline period during which the species was observed in the region. This baseline serves as a reference for assessing habitat changes over time. The tool will then use this information to identify whether populations observed during the baseline period have been exposed to subsequent habitat changes, potentially leading to local extinction.",,
1_1_ti,###### Name of species,,
1_1_te,The species name is used by the tool to retrieve species observation coordinates from GBIF. Please ensure the name entered matches the scientific name in the [GBIF database](https://www.gbif.org/).,,
1_1_in,Name of the species,,
1_2_ti,###### Geographic distribution of populations,,
1_2_te,Population polygons represent the geographic distribution of the studied populations. In this version the tool generates these polygons from species observations. In later versions the user will be able to directly provide population polygons in a geoJson format.,,
1_2_in,**Do you already have population polygons available?**,,
1_3a_ti,###### Upload polygons of populations distribution,,
1_3a_te,Click below to upload a geojson document containing the polygons defining the spatial distribution of populations.,,
1_3a_ex_ti,**-> How should the geojson document be formatted before upload?**,,
1_3a_ex_te,"The uploaded document must be in GeoJSON format and can include multiple polygons representing the spatial distribution of the studied populations. Each polygon must have an attribute named *pop* that contains a unique identifier for each population (e.g., *pop_1*, *pop_2*, *pop_3*, etc.). The coordinate system must be World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84), commonly used in GPS (EPSG:4326).",,
1_3b_te,"If population polygons are not available, the tool can generate them using species observation coordinates. Below, specify how you will provide these observation coordinates.",,
1_3b_ex_ti,**-> How to provide species coordinates?**,,
1_3b_ex_te,"The tool can generate population polygons by processing geographic coordinates of species observations. These coordinates can either be supplied by the user (Figure below, option 1) or retrieved from a public species observation repository [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/); option 2). ",,

1_5_ti,###### Distances for population definition,,
1_5_te,"Using coordinates of species observations, the tool generates polygons representing the spatial distribution of populations. These polygons are determined based on two distances: the observation distance and the population distance, which you need to specify below in kilometers.",,
1_5_ex_ti,**-> What do these distances represent?**,,
1_5_ex_te," The species observation coordinates are first converted into circles, representing the local areas where the species is expected to occur. These circles are defined using the **observation distance**, which corresponds to the radius of the circles. This distance accounts for the potential margin of error associated with the observation coordinates.\n\n Circles that are geographically close to one another are merged into population polygons. This merging is based on the **population distance**, a threshold that defines the maximum distance within which individuals of the same species are expected to share genetic similarity. Distances beyond this threshold indicate a separation in different populations. ",,

1_5_in2,Population distance [km],,
2_ti,##### Step 2: Select habitat change dataset,,
2_te,Choose the satellite-derived dataset that will be used to describe habitat changes for the species of interest. This dataset provides information on how suitable habitats for the species populations have evolved over time.,,
2_ex_ti,**-> Which datasets are available?**,,
2_ex_te,"The tool currently offers two options for estimating changes in suitable habitat over time: \n1. **[Landcover from the European Space Agency](https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/)**  \n- Provides global maps showing annual changes across 30 landcover classes. These classes are standardized and describe the features covering the Earth's surface, such as evergreen forests, deciduous forests, grasslands, agricultural areas, urban areas, and water bodies. \n- Ideal for analyzing large spatial scales (entire countries), or when focusing on non-forest species (e.g., species in low-vegetation habitats) or species associated with specific forest types (e.g., needle-leaved, evergreen, or deciduous forests). \n* Resolution: 300 meters. \n- Timeframe: 1992–2021. \n2. **[Tree Cover from Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/)** \n- Offers global maps detailing annual tree cover loss.    \n- Best suited for studying forest species in small geographic regions with homogenous forest types. \n- Resolution: 20 meters.  \n- Timeframe: 2000–2023.",,
2_1_in,**Habitat change Variable:**,,
2_1_1_ti,###### Landcover classes for suitable habitat identification,,
2_1_1_te,"The ESA Landcover dataset includes 23 classifiers representing various land use or vegetation types. You can specify below which of these categories constitute suitable habitat for the species being studied. Alternatively, **you can choose the option for the tool to automatically identify the most common landcover classes**, without the need for manual selection.",,

3_ti,##### Step 3: Set parameters for indicators estimation,,
3_te,"The surface area of each population polygon is used to estimate the population size (census size, Nc) based on a specified population density. This estimate is then converted into an effective population size (Ne) using a specified Ne:Nc ratio. You can provide multiple alternative values for both population density and the Ne:Nc ratio below, separated by a comma.",,
3_ex_ti,**-> What do these parameters represent?**,,
3_ex_te,"Population density and the Ne:Nc ratio are key parameters for defining population size. \n- **Population density** refers to the expected number of individuals of the species per 1 km² of suitable habitat. Since the tool estimates the species' suitable habitat area from space, population density helps determining the potential number of individuals inhabiting that area. As the area changes over time, the estimated population size will also shift accordingly. Multiple values for population density can be provided, and the indicators will be computed for each. \n- **Ne:Nc ratio** represents the ratio between the effective population size (Ne) and the census population size (Nc). The effective population size refers to the number of individuals in a population that contribute to reproduction. If this number is low, only a small portion of individuals are contributing to reproduction, increasing the risk of genetic erosion and potential extinction. As a general rule, an effective population size below 500 is considered at risk. The Ne:Nc ratio can vary across species. If the ratio is unknown for your species, a conservative estimate of 0.1 can be used, meaning that a population of 1,000 individuals will have an effective population size of 100.",,

6_ti,##### Step 6: Visualize the results,,
6_te,"The tool is currently running in Bon In a Box. You can check progresses and visualize results in the Bon In a Box interface, clicking on this link:  ",,
6_ex1_ti,**-> How to visualize the results?**,,
6_ex1_te,"By clicking on the link above, you will be redirected to the Bon in a Box interface, where your run executes. The Bon in a Box interface consists of three sections: \n\n **Inputs** (highlighted in pink): This section displays the parameters set to run the tool, as configured through the interactive form.\n\n **Results** (highlighted in blue): This is where the main outputs of the tool run will appear. Each run generates four key outputs: \n- A value for the PM indicator. \n- A value for the Ne500 indicator. \n- A table showing estimates of the effective population size for each population after habitat changes. Click on the link to open the table. \n- An interactive dashboard to visualize population distribution, habitat changes, and population size trends over time. Click on the link to display the dashboard. \n\n **Detailed Results** (highlighted in green): This section provides intermediary results from the pipeline processes executed during the run. The tool operates as a pipeline, where scripts handle specific tasks like retrieving GBIF observations, creating population polygons, or calculating genetic diversity indicators. If a loading icon appears next to a process, it indicates that the process is still running. Completed processes display their intermediary results here, with the next process starting automatically. Once all processes are complete, the overall results are shown in the Results section.",,
6_ex2_ti,**-> How to interpret the results?**,,
6_ex2_te,"The tool's output is displayed in the Results section of the Bon in a Box interface and includes the following components: \n\n **Population Maintained Indicator (PM)**: This indicator measures the fraction of populations maintained over time, based on population polygons derived from baseline species occurrences. It reflects whether populations still exist (i.e., have not completely lost their habitat) at the end of the habitat change period. A PM value of 1 indicates that all populations are still present, while a value of 0 means all populations have been lost. Note that the PM indicator does not provide details on populations partial declines, only whether they persist or not. \n\n **Ne>500 Indicator**: This indicator estimates the fraction of populations with an effective population size (Ne) above 500 units at the end of the habitat change period. Populations with Ne below 500 are at risk of genetic erosion. A value of 1 indicates that all populations are above the critical threshold, while 0 means none are. Unlike PM, note that this indicator does not describe population changes over time. \n\n **Effective Population Size**: This table presents the effective population size after habitat change for each population. Columns represent individual populations, and rows correspond to different estimates based on combinations of population density and Ne:Nc values provided as input. \n\n **Interactive plot**: The dashboard offers an interactive way to explore the results. The run's title and the Ne>500 and PM indicators are displayed at the top. \n- On the left, an interactive map shows population distribution, with zoom functionality and population names visible on hover. Habitat change data from Earth observations is displayed in the map's background. \n- The center of the interface includes graphs and tables on effective population size, with a graph showing how the effective population size of each population changed over time, and a table with effective population size estimates (same as in the Results section). \n- On the right, two graphs depict habitat change over time for each population in absolute terms (km_) and relative terms (%). \n\n Both graphs and maps are fully interactive. Clicking on a population in the map displays its trend in the graphs, and vice versa, allowing users to easily explore specific populations and their associated data. \n\n *In the example below, focusing on an oak species in Mexico, the Ne500 indicator is 0.62, meaning that around one-third of the populations are potentially at risk of genetic erosion, as their effective population size (Ne) has fallen below the critical threshold of 500. The PM indicator, however, is 1, indicating that none of the populations have completely lost their habitat. Examining the habitat change plot, we observe one population (highlighted in purple) that experienced a significant loss of approximately 80% of its habitat between 1994 and 2008.*",,

The Genes From Space monitoring tool uses Earth Observations (EO) to track habitat changes over time and infer population trends as indicators of genetic diversity.

    st.markdown('''Leveraging public EO data, the tool enables users to estimate two genetic diversity indicators adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity:
- the Ne500 indicator, indicating the fraction of populations with an effective population size (Ne) above 500 units. Populations with Ne below 500 units are at risk of genetic erosion.
- the Populations Maintained indicator (PM), indicating the fraction of populations that are maintained (i.e., that did not extinct) over time.
\nDeveloped within the BON in a box platform, the tool provides an interface that simplifies the process of accessingselecting EO datasets, running analyses, and estimatinginterpreting genetic diversity indicators. Ultimately, this tool offers a more scalable and accessible solution for researchers, conservationists, and policymakers to monitor and protect biodiversity at local, regional, and global levels.
For detailedmore information on methods and assumptions underlying the tool, Infos check out the Genes from Space website.

The tool runs within [Bon in a Box](http://130.60.24.27/pipeline-form), a platform designed to develop and share tools that support biodiversity monitoring. 
            The tool can be launched through the standard  [BON in a Box interface] (http://130.60.24.27/pipeline-form); however, the numerous options and parameters 
            may make this challenging for beginners. To address this, we propose the interactive form below, which guides users 
            through the preparation and execution of a run with the tool.

Use the form below to prepare and launch your tool run. As you complete each field, the form will dynamically reveal new options, guiding you step-by-step through the setup process.

1. Populations Distribution Map: This map represents the geographic distribution of the species' populations, typically derived from field observations of the studied species. The observation can be provided by the user, or retrieved from a public repository (GBIF) using the tool. 
2. Habitat Suitability Maps: These maps depict changes in the species' suitable habitat over time. These maps are generated by the tool using Earth observation-derived data and models. 
\n Using these inputs, the tool assesses how the size of suitable habitat for each population changes over time. This analysis can identify populations that have completely lost their habitat over a given period (estimating the PM indicator). Additionally, by combining suitable habitat size with an estimate of population density, the tool can estimate the size of each population, which is then used to estimate the Ne500 indicator.
The interactive form will ask which data to use for representing the populations distribution, habitat change, and set the parameters to estimate the indicators.

    The tool currently offers two options for estimating changes in suitable habitat over time:
    1. **Landcover from the European Space Agency**
    \t* Provides global maps showing annual changes across 30 landcover classes. These classes are standardized and describe the features covering the Earth's surface, such as evergreen forests, deciduous forests, grasslands, agricultural areas, urban areas, and water bodies.
    \t* Ideal for analyzing large spatial scales (entire countries), or when focusing on non-forest species (e.g., species in low-vegetation habitats) or species associated with specific forest types (e.g., needle-leaved, evergreen, or deciduous forests).
    \t* Resolution: 300 meters.
    \t* Timeframe: 1992‚Äì2021.
    2. **Tree Cover from Global Forest Watch**
    \t* Offers global maps detailing annual tree cover loss.
    \t* Best suited for studying forest species in small geographic regions with homogenous forest types.
    \t* Resolution: 20 meters.
